I think there are things to hopeful about for 2025

# Elixir and Gaming
Well, although I have entered into 2025 being unemployed again, there is definitely some stuff to be looking forward to.

For one thing, I'm kind of a free agent at the moment. I've been able to spend my time however I see fit which has been great. This has given me an opportunity to be able to spend some time studying up on game development more and to work on a presentation featuring a Poker application I had been working on in Elixir.

I spent all of this time learning Elixir and I'm coming out of my last job feeling like switching gears into something different. Hence, been looking into game development. Not to completely abandon Elixir, I've been looking into [PhoenixSharp](https://github.com/Mazyod/PhoenixSharp) which looks like it would be interesting because it provides a client to Phoenix Channels from Unity.

This is interesting because I believe with it I could be able to send information about a Unity game to Elixir and possibly use Elixir as a game server. Where I could use it to hold information about players moving around a world and be able to distribute that information back to all of the other players. It's worth a shot to see if it's even feasible.

# Community Building
I've recently began helping someone in the Elixir community with an ERP project they're working on. This person is an amazing programmer and can program incredibly quickly. They've been writing since they were 11 or 12 and at that age for me, I was still copying and pasting HTML.

I don't think I'm too much of a help to them. Although I want to be helpful and perhaps at times I've been helpful, I've not been as helpful as I wonder I could be. I've had a difficult time with this because I don't mind talking with this person about their project, but I'm not sure about putting time writing code into it myself because I don't understand it well. This guy would get through something much faster than myself.

But I think I can find other ways to be helpful.

# Life and Living
I think there is much more to life than practing leetcode all day for a programming job. I think what I would like for myself is to get some kind of job where I'm happy, I'm making money consistently, I can be there for a couple of years, and pay off my student loan debt.

However, it's possible that a job alone is not the answer and I'm going to need to find other ways of getting income for myself. I had watched a video today from a woman who had talked about how she had got herself 7 income streams but it took time for her to do this. She had done some of this by putting together videos for her YouTube channel talking about language learning and over time, developed an audience, put together courses, and makes some extra money. I wonder if I'd be capable of doing the same.

I'm the type of person who jumps around from idea to idea and don't tend to stick to anything long so whatever I decide, I really need to just dedicate myself to it wholely. However, there is nothing that I find so enjoyable that I would want to devote myself wholely too it, which might be part of my problem.

Well, I'm going to take advantage of my ability to go into anything and see if I might do well in sales. I might do well in all kinds of other things and speccing into IT and computers, probably just was not the right decision for me. At this point, all I can do is share what I have learned and that's one way I can keep what I learned from going to waste.
